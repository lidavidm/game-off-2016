# re/hack

Originally, this was supposed to be my entry into
the [Github Game Off 2016](https://github.com/github/game-off-2016/).
Unfortunately, real life took over, and I didn't end up completing it
in the month of November. However, I plan to still get the game into a
minimally playable state.

The game is inspired by an old Shockwave game LEGO had called
*Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident*. This game retains the key
tactical feature of that gameâ€”the health of your units is derived from
the number of spaces they have moved.

re/hack is written in Rust and renders in the terminal via Termion.
